3. **Network Configuration for RS Lidar Ruby Plus:**
Connect the RS-Lidar to PC over Ethernet cable and power supply. The sensor has set the default IP address to computer at factory, therefore configure the **default IP address** of the computer to ```192.168.1.102```, **sub-net mask** to ```255.255.255.0```. Besides, users should make sure that the ***RSView doesnâ€™t be blocked by any firewall or third party security software***.
4. **Startup RSView:**
   - Go to download directory of **RSView**
   - Open terminal and write
   ```bash run_rsview.sh``` </br>
      <img src="https://github.com/syedmohiuddinzia/ros_robosense_rubyplus/blob/main/images/1.png" alt="rosrun" width="500"/>
   - When RSView opens, then click on the **File** -> **Open** -> **Sensor Stream** </br>
      <img src="https://github.com/syedmohiuddinzia/ros_robosense_rubyplus/blob/main/images/2.png" alt="rosrun" width="750"/>
   - Configure the callibration values, and then **click OK**.
   - Leave **Group IP:** ```0.0.0.0``` and **Host IP:** ```0.0.0.0```, Configure the **MSOP Port:** ```6699``` and **DIFOP Port:** ```7788```. And then **click OK**.
   - Now you will see the stream of RS Lidar Ruby Plus.
  
## Setting up RS Lidar on Robot OS
5. **Clone and Catkin_make ROS Package:**
   - Navigate to src directory catkin_ws directory and download or clone the directory from the GitHub repository [here](https://github.com/RoboSense-LiDAR/rslidar_sdk.git).
     ```bash
     cd ~/catkin_ws/src
     git clone https://github.com/RoboSense-LiDAR/rslidar_sdk.git
     ```
   - Install dependency Yaml version >= v0.5.2 and libpcap version >= v1.7.4
      ```
      sudo apt-get update
      sudo apt-get install -y libyaml-cpp-dev
      sudo apt-get install -y  libpcap-dev
      ```
   - To compile using catkin_make method, open **CMakeLists.txt** and set the variable COMPILE_METHOD to CATKIN.
  
   - 
12. **Run ROS Core:**
Start the ROS core by running the following command in a terminal:
     ```bash
     roscore
     ```
13. **Run Reach RS2 ROS Driver Node:**
Launch the Reach RS2 ROS driver node with specific parameters for host/IP and port using the following command:
     ```bash
     rosrun reach_rs_driver reach_rs_driver_node _reach_rs_host_or_ip:=192.168.137.231 _reach_rs_port:=9001
     ```
14. **Ensure Reach RS2 is connected on ROS**
If everything is working fine, you will see
   ```
   [INFO] [1719069234.009935]: Connecting to 192.168.137.231:9001...
   [INFO] [1719069234.100768]: Successfully connected to device!
